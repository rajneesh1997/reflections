was introduced?

    without any effort

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    compare and rectify program lines, or sometime rollback to previous one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro is we can specify what error was rectified.
    con is for different logical erros we should write commit, unecessary making the command lenghty.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files may be linked with each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log displays commits
    git diff helps us differentiate the changes between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
